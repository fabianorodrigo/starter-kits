CSS Flexbox
===

User interface module to explorer features of the [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/), a layout model that allows responsive elements be organized automatically inside an another container element.

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.



# Components

### demo-justify-content

# Pages

### justify-content

It also allows the user change a group of others flexbox properties so it is possible to compare a large number of configurations.
